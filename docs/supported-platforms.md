## MP3 Audio Support

- MP3 download is supported for all platforms that offer a valid video stream.
- Converts video to audio using internal tools — no extra steps needed.

## Multi-Link Support

!!! danger
    Only supported Instagram.
    You can download **multiple links at once** in batch mode using a `.txt` file.

**How it works:**

1. Create a `.txt` file with one URL per line (example: `links.txt`)
2. Run the downloader and provide the file path when prompted.
3. The downloader will process each link one by one.

!!! important
